# Adafruit PWM Servo Driver for MATLAB

Custom MATLAB Add-on for AdafruitPWMServoDriver for Arduino

To use, install Adafruit_PWM_Servo_Driver_Library in your Arduino path and run the following:

```MATLAB
addpath('XXXX')
a = arduino('COM5','Uno','Libraries','Adafruit/PWMservoDriver')
shield = addon(a,'Adafruit/PWMservoDriver','I2CAddress','0x40')

```

To find the I2CAddess of your board:
```MATLAB
i2cAddress = scanI2CBus(controller)
```

Adafruit PWM Servo Driver: https://www.adafruit.com/product/815
<br>The addon and the library have been tried both with the official Adafruit 12-Channel 16-bit PWM LED Driver - SPI Interface - TLC59711 and with generic PCA9685 PWM LED and Servo drivers as well.
